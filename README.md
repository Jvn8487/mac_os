Shell scripts for automated macOS machine setup.

This project is a framework for automating the setup of a macOS machine. In order to illustrate the
potential of what this project can do, please see the companion
[macOS Config](https://github.com/bkuhlmann/mac_os-config) project for details. The *macOS Config*
project is an opinionated configuration which meets the needs of my development environment but is
also meant to serve as an example and guide for building your own personalized setup. Here is how
the two projects are meant to be used:

- **macOS** (this project) - Foundation and framework for building customizated macOS machine
  setups.
- **[macOS Configuration](https://github.com/bkuhlmann/mac_os-config)** - The layer on top of this
  *macOS* project which defines a custom machine setup and base implementation. The project is meant
  to be forked for as many custom machine setups as needed.

## Screencast

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/88971.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/88971)

## Requirements

0. [macOS High Sierra](https://www.apple.com/macos) (with latest software updates applied)
0. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) (with accepted license agreement)

## Setup

Open a terminal window and execute one of the following setup sequences depending on your version
preference:

Current Version (stable):

    git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/mac_os.git
    cd mac_os
    git checkout v4.0.0

Master Version (unstable):

    git clone https://github.com/bkuhlmann/mac_os.git
    cd mac_os

## Usage

Run the following script:

    bin/run

You will be presented with the following options:

    Boot:
       B:  Create boot disk.
    Install:
       b:  Apply basic settings.
       t:  Install development tools.
      hf:  Install Homebrew Formulas.
      hc:  Install Homebrew Casks.
       m:  Install Mac App Store software.
       a:  Install application software.
       x:  Install application software extensions.
       d:  Apply default settings.
       s:  Setup installed software.
       i:  Install everything (i.e. executes all install options).
    Restore:
       R:  Restore settings from backup.
    Manage:
       c:  Check status of managed software.
       C:  Caffeinate machine.
      ua:  Uninstall application software.
      ux:  Uninstall application software extension.
      ra:  Reinstall application software.
      rx:  Reinstall application software extension.
       w:  Clean work (temp) directory.
       q:  Quit/Exit.

Choose option `i` to run all install options or select a specific option to run a single option.
Each option is designed to be re-run if necessary. This can also be handy for performing upgrades,
re-running a missing/failed install, etc.

The option prompt can be skipped by passing the desired option directly to the `bin/run` script. For
example, executing `bin/run i` will execute the complete software install process.

The machine should be rebooted after all install tasks have completed to ensure all settings have
been loaded.

It is recommended that the `mac_os` project directory not be deleted and kept on the local machine
in order to manage installed software and benefit from future upgrades.

### Customization

All executable scripts can be found in the `bin` folder:

- `bin/apply_basic_settings`: Applies basic, initial, settings for setting up a machine. *This is
  meant to be customized.*
- `bin/apply_default_settings`: Applies useful system and application defaults. *This is meant to be
  customized.*
- `bin/create_boot_disk`: Creates macOS boot disk.
- `bin/install_app_store`: Installs macOS, GUI-based, App Store applications. *This is meant to be
  customized.*
- `bin/install_applications`: Installs macOS, GUI-based, non-App Store applications. *This is meant
  to be customized.*
- `bin/install_dev_tools`: Installs macOS development tools required by Homebrew.
- `bin/install_extensions`: Installs macOS application extensions and add-ons. *This is meant to be
  customized.*
- `bin/install_homebrew_casks`: Installs Homebrew Formulas. *This is meant to be customized.*
- `bin/install_homebrew_formulas`: Installs Homebrew Casks. *This is meant to be customized.*
- `bin/restore_backup`: Restores system/application settings from backup image. *This is meant to be
  customized.*
- `bin/run`: The main script and interface for macOS setup.
- `bin/setup_software`: Configures and launches (if necessary) installed software. *This is meant to
  be customized.*

The `lib` folder provides the base framework for installing, re-installing, and uninstalling
software. Everything provided via the [macOS Config](https://github.com/bkuhlmann/mac_os-config)
project is built upon the functions found in the `lib` folder. See the
[macOS Config](https://github.com/bkuhlmann/mac_os-config) project for further details.

  - `lib/settings.sh`: Defines global settings for software applications, extensions, etc.
